# Any PyTest should be start with  test_ or end with _test .
# -k stands for method execution,. -s for logs in out put , -v for more info metadata
# you can run specific file with py.test <FileName> or with -K <Keyword name>
# you can run test case with using mark annotation like pytest -m <name> -v -s
# if there is any bug in the application and uh know that this will be failed so how to represent to the client without showing the skip testcase
     pytest.mark.skip and pytest.mark.skipif
# if one testcase is dependednt on second one then with skip all the test cases will be fail so thats why
     we use this annotation so that testcase will run but not show in the report.
     @pytest.mark.xfail
# pytest fixture is work with mostly same as testng before test and after test
# we can declare fixture anywhere like in the begining or anywhere on the page
# yield keyword will work like after test or complete testcases execution and at the last yield state execute
# pytest -m "mark name" it will execute testcases having mark in case of not we use -m "not"
